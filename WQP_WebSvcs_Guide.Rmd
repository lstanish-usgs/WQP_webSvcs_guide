## Introduction 
The Water Quality Data Portal (WQP) provides easy access to data stored in three large water quality databases (WQX, NWIS, STEWARDS) through a web-based form interface as well as standalone web services. Both the form interface and the web services use the same input parameters (filters) and produce the same output formats. The web service enables programmatic access to WQP data and metadata without manually interacting with the form interface. 

You can use the WQP web services to quickly and easily access data and metadata available on the Water Quality Portal. URL queries are constructed in a standard format and outputs are delivered in JSON format.

For more information on the WQP input parameters (filters) and data downloads, see the WQP [User Guide](http://www.waterqualitydata.us/portal_userguide.jsp).  


## What Are Web Services?

APIs (Application Programming Interface) and Web Services are tools that enable communication between two networked devices or pieces of software using  standardized methods. They are implemented in almost all of our mobile device applications that we use on a daily basis. They allow data from one system to be easily used by a second system without requiring the second system to locally store the data, which is especially beneficial when we are dealing with *big* data sets. In fact, common software packages including Excel and R are starting to come pre-packaged with the ability to use these services.

While APIs and Web Services provide similar functions, the types of communication they allow differs: 

  * An API allows two applications to communicate by creating shared rules and conventions. These can be used with a network connection, but there are also APIs that do not involve a network connection. 
  
  * A web service is a *type* of API that allows one computer to communicate data to another computer in a standardized way. While all web services are APIs, not all API's are web services. 

The WQP web services are implemented using the 'https' protocol using REST, which provides a flexible and scalable approach for constructing standardized URL statements.

### Accessing Data Programmatically Through Web Services

Web services provide a public resource which users can also enhance with their own custom scripts.

One resource created by the USGS is an R-based software package called *dataRetrieval*, which makes it easier for R users to use the WQP web services. *dataRetrieval* does the heavy lifting to download data and convert it into a familiar and usable format. *dataRetrevial* can download data from the WQP and from a number of USGS NWIS services. To learn more about *dataRetrieval*, please check out these resources:

## How to Generate Web Services Requests

You can retrieve the *same* data using Web Services as you can with the WQP User Interface (advanced form). Query basics are outlined in the following series of tables. Most non-alphanumeric characters (such as punctuation) must be ["**url-encoded**"](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_url_encoding.htm), (*for example*: space is "%20").

Constructing a Request:

Every request starts with a base URL: the base URL will vary depending on the type of information requested:

* Base URL for downloading site data and associated metadata: `https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/Station/search?`
* Base URL for downloading results: `https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/Result/search?`
* Base URL for downloading activity data: `https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/Activity/search?`
* Base URL for downloading activity metric data: `https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/ActivityMetric/search?`

Construct a query by concatenating the base URL with the desired parameters and arguments,as shown in ***Table 1***.  At least one parameter-argument pair must be specified. Separate multiple parameter-argument pairs with an *ampersand* ("&"). For downloads, if no file format (*mime type*) is specified, the retrieval will default to **WQX-XML format**. See the [WQP User Guide](http://www.waterqualitydata.us/portal_userguide.jsp) for a list of elements included in the result retrievals.

However, sorting increases response time significantly, sometimes by orders of magnitude. If you are doing your own sorting after download, set sorted=no. For large downloads (over 5 million rows) sorting is disabled by default to ensure reasonable response times. XML requests are always sorted to accommodate the WQX data schema. |   |

### Example Web Service Requests

To try out the following examples of REST web service requests, copy and paste into a web browser.


>*Example:* REST web service request to retrieve sites from *Oklahoma County, Oklahoma*, where *Atrazine* was measured in *XML* format, *zipped*:

`https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/Station/search?countycode=US%3A40%3A109&characteristicName=Atrazine&mimeType=xml&zip=yes`

>*Example:* REST web service request to retrieve sites contained within a *bounding box* where *Caffeine* was measured in *KML* format, *zipped*:

`https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/Station/search?characteristicName=Caffeine&mimeType=kml&bBox=-92.8,44.2,-88.9,46.0&zip=yes` 

>*Example:* REST web service request to retrieve stream sites located in the state of Wyoming (USA) where parameters of the characteristicType *Nutrient* were measured, in *GeoJSON* format:

`https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/Station/search?countrycode=US&statecode=US%3A56&siteType=Stream&characteristicType=Nutrient&mimeType=geojson` 

>*Example:* REST web service request to retrieve *Caffeine* sample results from sites contained within a *bounding box* and *collected on, or after, 10-01-2006* in *MS-Excel* format, *zipped*:

`https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/Result/search?characteristicName=Caffeine&bBox=-92.8,44.2,-88.9,46.0&startDateLo=10-01-2006&mimeType=xlsx&zip=yes` 



### Queries Using POST

In certain situations when very long requests are submitted - for example, when querying data for a large list of sites - GET requests can fail due to limits in the allowable length of the request. These requests can instead be completed using http POST. POST requests should be submitted with a JSON-formatted payload.

Here's an example *JSON* object, including an organization ID and three site ID's:

```
{
"organization": ["WIDNR_WQX"],
"siteid": ["WIDNR_WQX-133003", "WIDNR_WQX-133398", "WIDNR_WQX-133486"]
}
```

An example using *curl* with these data looks like this:

```
curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/zip' -d '{"organization":["WIDNR_WQX"],"siteid":["WIDNR_WQX-133003","WIDNR_WQX-133398","WIDNR_WQX-133486"]} \ 
 ' 'https://www.waterqualitydata.us/data/Station/search?mimeType=csv&zip=yes'
```

The --header argument lists metadata for the web service and ensures that the correct information is received and returned. If there are any problems with the request, they are returned in the response via the warning header(s). See [RFC 2616 Section 14](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.46) for the format of the warning header. 



### Using Open Geospatial Consortium Services to map Water Quality Portal sites based on Water Quality Portal Parameters

The Water Quality Portal has an endpoint for generating OGC-Compliant Geospatial web services. At this time, [Web Mapping Service (WMS)](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/services/wms/reference.html) version 1.1.1 and [Web Feature Service (WFS)](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/services/wfs/reference.html) version 1.1.1 are supported. The service is a customized version of the WMS and WFS services provided by [Geoserver](http://www.geoserver.org/). To get started, check out the Geoserver WMS Reference and WFS Reference. The base URL for both the WMS and WFS services is:

`https://www.waterqualitydata.us/ogcservices/{wms|wfs}`

Use web mapping tools, such as *Leaflet* or *Openlayers*, to easily connect to these web map services. GIS tools such as *ArcGIS* and *QGIS* also connect to these web maps services.

WFS and WMS services require an additional parameter, called "SearchParams", which is a URL-encoded version of the WQP search parameters. The service supports calls up to up to 250,000 sites. Calls that return large numbers of sites will take longer to load for the first time, as a cache is populated; subsequent responses will be much quicker. The cache is cleared after new data are loaded to the portal (once a day, at night).

At this time, we support WMS GetMap, WMS GetFeatureInfo, and WMS GetLegendGraphic.

**WMS Getmap** 

* For detailed information on constructing a WMS getmap request, refer to the [GetMap documentation at the Geoserver site](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/services/wms/reference.html#getmap).  
* Here is an example GetMap Request for stream sites that have samples for *atrazine*:

`https://www.waterqualitydata.us/ogcservices/wms?SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetMap&VERSION=1.1.1&LAYERS=wqp_sites&STYLES=wqp_sources&FORMAT=image%2Fpng&TRANSPARENT=true&HEIGHT=256&WIDTH=256&SEARCHPARAMS=countrycode%3AUS%3BcharacteristicName%3AAtrazine&SRS=EPSG%3A3857&BBOX=-15028131.257091932,-7.081154551613622e-10,-10018754.171394622,5009377.085697313`


### **Looking Up Domain Values Through Web Services**

The allowable values for each query variable (referred to as *domain values*) may change over time as new values are added. There is a web service request that allows you to look up which values are allowed for a query parameter. 

A list of parameter names and arguments to use for these web service requests is shown in ***Table 2***.

Base URL for looking up domain values: `https://www.waterqualitydata.us/Codes/{endpointName}?{parameter}`

You must provide at least one argument in the web service call. If you want all domain values, you can just specify the *mimetype* (e.g. mimeType=json).
